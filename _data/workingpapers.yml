However over the following years their numbers decreased considerably; in 2011, there were 180 MDIs across the US while 138 such institutions exist as of 2021. Consequently, from 2011 to 2021, the number of MDI branches operating decreased from 1411 to 1195, either due to mergers or failures of MDIs. In this paper, I examine whether the closure of a MDI branch within a census tract or local market results in less access to credit within the racial community that the MDI was designated to serve when compared to another census tract with a similar demographic and bank branch composition that still had at least one functioning MDI branch. Using an event study design, I find evidence that mortgage loans originations within the Asian community decrease due to the closure of a MDI branch designated to serve the community. However, mortgage loan originations within other racial communities are not impacted when a MDI branch closes in their local markets. I also study the closure of a non MDI bank branch in each of these census tracts and find that the total mortgage loan originations to the Black community  decreases when a non MDI bank branch closes in their local markets.'}

A Nonparametric Approach to Determine the Characteristics of Banks that Influenced Their Ability to Distribute PPP Loans', url: '/workingpapers/draft_2_sep10_2023.pdf', description: 'Abstract: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was an emergency measure taken during Covid-19 pandemic to support small businesses that faced mandated business closures. The businesses were supposed to use PPP loans to help fund payroll costs, including benefits, and also use these loans to pay for mortgage interest, rent, utilities, worker protection costs related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Using Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Call Report data from June 2020, I measure how much PPP loans/assets were given out by FDIC registered banks. I look at commercial and industrial loan commitments (C&I) to large businesses, C&I loans issued for small businesses, unused C&I loan commitments, core deposits and liquid assets as predictors for the amount of PPP loans given out per bank. I use nonparametric multivariate Kernel regressions and semiparametric smooth coefficient Kernel regressions to understand what institutional features lead to a higher amount of PPP loans/asset for every bank. All the explanatory variables except C&I loan commitments to small businesses of less than $250,000 and liquid assets positively influence the amount of PPP loans/asset that are disbursed by banks.'}

An Analysis with Count Data Models.', url: '/workingpapers/draft_3_sep10_2023.pdf', description: 'Abstract: This paper analyzes whether facing extreme weather events increases the probability of households taking up multiple loans. We test four separate models: (a) Poisson model, (b) Negative Binomial model, (c) Hurdle model and (d) Zero inflated Poisson model. The Zero inflated Poisson model was the most appropriate model to use for the data because of the presence of overdispersion and as well as a very high percentage (about 68%) of zero observations and the fact that the zero observations were both "structural" and due to "sampling". We see that households that face extreme weather events, households that own agricultural or non agricultural enterprises, households with members suffering from chronic illness and those who have faced sudden illness or death of an earning member are all significantly likely to make up multiple loans as predicted by each of the models separately.'}

However over the following years their numbers decreased considerably and 138 such institutions exist as of 2020. From 2011 to 2020, the number of MDI branches operating decreased from 1358 to 1191, some of which where sold while others closed . I use a Difference in Difference approach, with propensity score matching, to study whether the closure of a MDI branch within a census tract results in decreased credit within the community when compared to another census tract with a similar demographic and income composition that still has  at least one functioning MDI branch. I use Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) data and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to build estimates of small business loans and mortgage lending by census tracts. I then compare census tracts where an MDI branch closed to a similar census tract that had at least one MDI during the period under study and did not have any MDI branch closure.'}
