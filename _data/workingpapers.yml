The research contrasts credit outcomes due to two different kinds of bank branch closures, the closure of Minority Depository Institution (MDI) branches versus the closure of non MDI branches. The number of MDIs peaked in the year 2008, reaching 215. However in 2011, there were 180 MDIs across the US and as of 2021, 138 such institutions exist. Consequently, there was a 15 percent reduction in the number of MDI branches from 2011 to 2021, either due to mergers or failures of MDIs. Using a novel dataset, I examine whether the closure of a MDI branch in the local market results in less access to credit within the racial community that the MDI was designated to serve. I contrast this result by also studying how credit outcomes vary within the same racial community when a non MDI branch closes in the same local market.'}

A Nonparametric Approach to Determine the Characteristics of Banks that Influenced Their Ability to Distribute PPP Loans', url: '/workingpapers/draft2_may11_2024.pdf', description: 'Abstract: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was an emergency measure taken during Covid-19 pandemic to support small businesses that faced mandated business closures. The businesses were supposed to use PPP loans to help fund payroll costs, including benefits, and also use these loans to pay for mortgage interest, rent, utilities, worker protection costs related to the Covid-19 pandemic. Using Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Call Report data from June 2020, I measure how much PPP loans/assets were given out by FDIC registered banks. I use nonparametric multivariate Kernel regressions and semiparametric smooth coefficient Kernel regressions to understand what institutional features lead to a higher amount of PPP loans/asset for every bank.'}

- {name: 'How Extreme Weather Events Impact the Frequency of Loan Take-up by Bangladeshi Households in Vulnerable Communities: An Analysis with Count Data Models.', url: '/workingpapers/draft3_may11_2024.pdf', description: 'Abstract: This paper analyzes whether facing extreme weather events increases the probability of rural Bangladeshi households to take up multiple loans. Microcredit loans are marketed to low income rural households that do not have access to private and public commercial banks. These institutions charge higher interest rates than commercial banks and practice predatory lending. Using count data models, I show that households that face extreme weather events, households that own agricultural or non agricultural enterprises, households with members suffering from chronic illness and those who have faced sudden illness or death of an earning member are all significantly likely to make up multiple loans from microcredit institutions.'}
