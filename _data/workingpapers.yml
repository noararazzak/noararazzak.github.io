My findings reveal minimal negative effects of branch closures on credit accessibility, with a few notable exceptions: 1) Asian MDI branch closures reduces large mortgage originations within the Asian community, 2) Hispanic MDI branch closures decreases small business loan originations for small firms, and 3) non-MDI branch closures lowers mortgage originations in Black communities served by Black MDIs. However, non-MDI bank branch closures unexpectedly increases total small business loan originations. Using lender level Herfindahl–Hirschman index (HHI), I show branch closure decisions are primarily driven by increased competition from branchless banking rather than expected future loan demand. These findings highlight the evolving role of physical bank branches in an increasingly digital banking landscape. '}

A Nonparametric Approach to Determine the Characteristics of Banks that Influenced Their Ability to Distribute PPP Loans', url: '/workingpapers/draft2_aug16_2024.pdf', description: 'Abstract: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was an emergency measure taken during Covid-19 pandemic to support small businesses that faced mandated business closures. Using Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Call Report data from June 2020, I measure how much PPP loans/assets were given out by FDIC registered banks. I use nonparametric multivariate Kernel regressions and semiparametric smooth coefficient Kernel regressions to understand what institutional features lead to a higher amount of PPP loans/asset for every bank. I find that commercial and industrial loan commitments (C&I) to large businesses, C&I loans larger than $250,000 issued to small businesses, unused C&I loan commitments, core deposits and the status of the institutions as community banks, all positively influence the amount of PPP loans/asset that are disbursed by banks.'}

Microcredit loans are marketed to low income rural households that do not have access to commercial banks. These institutions charge higher interest rates than commercial banks and practice predatory lending. Using count data models, I show that households that face extreme weather events, households that own agricultural or non agricultural enterprises, households with members suffering from chronic illness and those who have faced sudden illness or death of an earning member are all significantly likely to make up multiple loans from microcredit institutions.
