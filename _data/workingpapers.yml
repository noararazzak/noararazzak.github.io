My analysis reveals four main findings that illustrate differential impacts from the closure of Minority Depository Institution (MDI) branches and non-MDI branches within their local markets, defined by census tracts. First, closure of Asian MDI branches reduces large mortgage originations only within the Asian community. Second, closure of Hispanic MDI branches reduces small business loan originations to firms with less than $1 million in assets. Third, closure of non-MDI branches decreases mortgage loan originations to the Black community within tracts served by Black MDIs. Fourth, closure of non-MDI bank branches increases total small business loan originations. Using lender level Herfindahl–Hirschman index, I show the decision to close branches is driven by increased competition from branchless banking rather than by expected future loans. These findings highlight the evolving role of physical bank branches in an increasingly digital banking landscape.'}

A Nonparametric Approach to Determine the Characteristics of Banks that Influenced Their Ability to Distribute PPP Loans', url: '/workingpapers/draft2_aug16_2024.pdf', description: 'Abstract: The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was an emergency measure taken during Covid-19 pandemic to support small businesses that faced mandated business closures. Using Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Call Report data from June 2020, I measure how much PPP loans/assets were given out by FDIC registered banks. I use nonparametric multivariate Kernel regressions and semiparametric smooth coefficient Kernel regressions to understand what institutional features lead to a higher amount of PPP loans/asset for every bank. I find that commercial and industrial loan commitments (C&I) to large businesses, C&I loans larger than $250,000 issued to small businesses, unused C&I loan commitments, core deposits and the status of the institutions as community banks, all positively influence the amount of PPP loans/asset that are disbursed by banks.'}

Microcredit loans are marketed to low income rural households that do not have access to commercial banks. These institutions charge higher interest rates than commercial banks and practice predatory lending. Using count data models, I show that households that face extreme weather events, households that own agricultural or non agricultural enterprises, households with members suffering from chronic illness and those who have faced sudden illness or death of an earning member are all significantly likely to make up multiple loans from microcredit institutions.
