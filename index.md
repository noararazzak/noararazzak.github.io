Hello, I am Noara Razzak, a PhD Candidate in the John E. Walker Department of Economics at Clemson University. I conduct research on financial markets and community banking with aligned interests in industrial organization, urban economics and applied econometrics. My job market paper (jmp) studies the effect of branch closures of Minority Depository Institutions in their local markets, defined by census tracts. My research interests include studying credit accessibility of different communities along with the institutional and geographical features of the credit markets that these communities can access.
