Hello, I am Noara Razzak, a PhD Candidate in the John E. Walker Department of Economics at Clemson University. I conduct research on financial markets and community banking with aligned interests in industrial organization, urban economics and applied econometrics.  My research interests include studying credit accessibility of racially diverse communities along with the institutional and geographical features of the credit markets that these communities can access. My job market paper (jmp) studies the effect of branch closures of Minority Depository Institutions in their local markets, defined by census tracts. I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.
